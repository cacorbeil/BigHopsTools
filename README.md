# BigHopsTools
Slightly cleaned up, standalone tools I'm using for project Big Hops

IMPORTANT:
- All files under Assets/Plugins/Luckshot fall under the included LICENSE file:
- Each folder can be taken alone, but likely has dependencies on stuff in the Utils folder
- Many scripts have dependencies on NaughtyAttributes which also falls under MIT license (https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes/blob/master/LICENSE)
- Some scripts (like Decal and PathBase were inspired by existing tools, those references should be noted in the related scripts)
